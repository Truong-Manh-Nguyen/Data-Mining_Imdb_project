# Data-Mining-Imdb-project
This repository includes all my lab exercise in the course Data Mining 1 at University of Pisa for my 1nd semester of Master in Data Science and Business Informatics Program. There are 5 main parts: Data Understanding and Preparation, Clustering, Classification, Pattern Mining and Regression.
To better read the procedure, you can check the file Project Data Mining_Truong.pdf
## Data Understanding and Preparation
Coding for this step is presented at Data Mining Train Ankit file. 
We apply some methods to analyze the Data structure and understand the distribution. 
Then filling missing values based on API data and substitution of values methods (Data segmentation and using mean). 
Next, we also check for outliers based on Mahalanobis Distance to remove outliers for the whole dataset.
Finally, we do the data transformation step and then caculate the Pairwise Coirrelations.

## Clustering 
Coding for this step is presented at Clustering_TruongNguyen.ipynb.
We respectively apply K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering to the dataset.
## Classification
Coding for this step is presented at Classification for averagerating.ipynb, Classification for titleType.ipynb, Classification_Decision_Tree.ipynb, Classification_Knn_NaiveBayes.ipynb.
We respectively apply KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes to the dataset with the target variables: titleType, averageRating.
## Pattern Mining & Regression
Coding for this step is presented at pattern mining 22-12-2024.ipynb, Linear Regression.ipynb, KNN Regressor.ipynb, Decision Tree Regressor.ipynb.
We apply both Apriori and FP-Growth agorithms for pattern mining.
Then applying linear and non-linear regression.
